Associations between the duration and quality of sleep of pregnant women in the third trimester with the duration of labor  [Master’s Thesis, University of São Paulo]. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S4TBZ\n\nThe text below is related to the project of this thesis. The final abstract can only be produced when the research is completed.\nAmong the biopsychosocial changes that occur during pregnancy are alterations in the sleep-wake cycle pattern. Research suggests that there are associations between the duration and quality of sleep in pregnant women during the prenatal period and adverse maternal-infant health outcomes. The primary aim of this project is to investigate the presence/absence of significant associations between the duration and quality of sleep in pregnant women in the third trimester and the duration of labor. For this purpose, a study will be conducted with 133 pregnant women in the third trimester, followed up at SUS birthing centers located in the city of São Paulo. Demographic, anthropometric, obstetric, actigraphic, sleep-related, and psychological state data will be collected from the participants, in addition to secondary data from the women’s medical records and prenatal books. The study has already obtained all necessary ethical approvals from the competent authorities. The results will be analyzed by comparing group means through an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The hypothesis is that poorer sleep quality and duration throughout pregnancy are associated with a longer duration of labor. In addition to training and capacitating professionals and generating knowledge on a public health issue, it is expected that this study will promote and contribute to the development of new services and technologies for monitoring pregnant women, highlighting the relevance of the sleep-wake cycle for maternal-infant health. \nKeywords: Pregnancy.

Associações entre a duração e a qualidade do sono de gestantes no terceiro trimestre com a duração do trabalho de parto [Dissertação de Mestrado, Universidade de São Paulo].\n\nO texto abaixo está relacionado ao projeto desta dissertação. O resumo final só poderá ser produzido quando a pesquisa for finalizada.\nDentre as alterações biopsicossociais que ocorrem durante a gravidez estão as mudanças no padrão do ciclo sono-vigília. Pesquisas sugerem que há associações entre a duração e a qualidade do sono de gestantes no período pré-natal com desfechos adversos na saúde materno-infantil. O objetivo deste projeto é investigar a presença/ausência de associações significativas entre a duração e a qualidade do sono de gestantes no terceiro trimestre com a duração do trabalho de parto. Para isso, será realizado um estudo com 133 gestantes no terceiro trimestre gestacional acompanhadas em casas de parto do SUS, localizadas no município de São Paulo. Serão coletados dados sociodemográficos, antropométricos, obstétricos, actigráficos, dados relacionados ao sono e ao estado psicológico das participantes, além de dados secundários dos prontuários e cadernetas das gestantes. O estudo já obteve todas as aprovações éticas para sua operação por parte das autoridades competentes. Os resultados serão analisados pela comparação das médias entre grupos por meio de uma análise de covariância (ANCOVA). A hipótese é que uma menor qualidade e duração de sono no final do terceiro trimestre gestacional estão associadas a uma maior duração do trabalho de parto. Além de formar e capacitar profissionais e gerar conhecimento em um assunto de interesse público, espera-se que este estudo promova e contribua para o desenvolvimento de novos serviços e tecnologias de acompanhamento de gestantes, destacando a relevância do ciclo sono-vigília para a saúde materno-infantil. \nPalavras-chaves: Gravidez.
